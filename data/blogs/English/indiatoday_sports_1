Jason Gillespie denied that he had no immediate plans of leaving county side Yorkshire for any new coaching job. Gillespie's name has been doing the rounds to be Australia's next coach, but the former pacer has rubbished all the rumours.
"I haven't had any contact, so there's nothing to report to be honest. If anything changes, I'll let you know. At this point, it's just focusing on my role here," Gillespie told the county side's official website.
The 41-year-old has built a strong reputation for himself as a coach after guiding Yorkshire to successive County Championship titles. Last year there were strong chances of him becoming England's coach replacing Peter Moores but the job went to Trevor Bayliss.
Gillespie, who took 259 wickets in 71 Tests is presently not thinking of any new assignment beyond county side Yorkshire and wants to work with them.
"You don't rule out opportunities in the future. It's whether you feel like you can make a difference in any job that comes available.
"It's well documented that I've got four kids under the age of 10. My eldest daughter, she's 21, has just had a little girl. So family is important, and it should be an important consideration.
"Any job that comes up, certainly, I've always said family comes first. If any opportunities come up in the future, that would certainly be a consideration."
